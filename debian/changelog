acme-wrapper (1.0.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Take debian/ packaging files thankfully prepared by Christian M.
    Ams√ºss <chrysn@fsfe.org> and convert the whole project into
    shipping a debian package.
  * Use Python 3.
  * acme-tiny no longer included, now depends on debian package 'acme-tiny'.
  * move from opt-package to debian-package directory layout.
  * FIX: debuild produces warning
    "dpkg-gencontrol: warning: Depends field of package acme-wrapper:
    substitution variable ${shlibs:Depends} used, but is not defined"
  * make test-suite such that is runs during deb build.
