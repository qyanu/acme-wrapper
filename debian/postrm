## NOTICE:
## Not removing the user 'acme-wrapper', because there doesn't seem
## to be a clear guideline what is the officialy debian thing to do.

## TODO:
## Think about the situation of the added user 'acme-wrapper' even
## after this package was purged, and maybe there is a good solution
## for this package despite no general guidelines.
